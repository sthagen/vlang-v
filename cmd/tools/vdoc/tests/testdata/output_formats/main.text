module main

const omega = 3 // should be first
const alpha = 5 // should be in the middle
const beta = 2 // should be at the end
fn abc()
    abc - should be last
fn def()
    def - should be first
fn xyz()
    xyz - should be in the middle
fn MyXMLDocument.abc(text string) ?(string, int)
    MyXMLDocument.abc does something too... I just do not know what.
fn MyXMLDocument.from_file(path string) !MyXMLDocument
    MyXMLDocument.from_text processes the file path, and returns an error
fn MyXMLDocument.from_text(text string) ?MyXMLDocument
    MyXMLDocument.from_text processes text and produces none
struct MyXMLDocument {
	path string
}
    MyXMLDocument is here just to test the different combinations of methods/output types
fn (x &MyXMLDocument) instance_from_file(path string) !MyXMLDocument
    instance_from_file does stuff with path
fn (x &MyXMLDocument) instance_from_text(text string) ?MyXMLDocument
    instance_from_text does stuff with text
fn (x &MyXMLDocument) instance_abc(text string) ?(string, int)
    instance_abc does stuff too
fn (x &MyXMLDocument) instance_void()
    instance_void does stuff too
fn (x &MyXMLDocument) instance_int() int
    instance_int does stuff too
fn (x &MyXMLDocument) instance_result() !
    instance_error does stuff too
fn (x &MyXMLDocument) instance_option() ?
    instance_option does stuff too
