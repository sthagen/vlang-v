Usage:
  v where [symbol_type] [symbol_name] [params]

Examples:
  v where fn main
  v where struct User
  v where fn say_hello -mod Person
  v where fn area -m-of Square
  v where interface callable -dir some -dir other

Prints the location of the searched symbols in the scope of the current project.

symbol_name can be:
  fn                    (by default if omit [symbol_type])
  struct
  interface
  enum
  const
  var
  regexp

params:
  -mod  [mod_name]      Restrict to search recursively only within of the given 
                        module, if not provided search in entire v scope.
  -dir  [dir_path]      Restrict to search non recursively within the given 
                        folder/s, if not provided, search in entire v scope.
  -vis  [visibility]    Can be: all, pub, pri (all by default if not provided).
                        Restrict to search symbols with the given visibility.
  -mut  [mutability]    Can be: any, yes, not (any by default if not provided).
                        Restrict to search symbols with the given mutability.
  -m-of [struct_name]   (just for fn symbol_name).
                        Restrict to search fn as method of the given struct.
flags:
  -h                    Include header
  -f                    Format output (each match uses 3 lines)
  -v                    For both above
